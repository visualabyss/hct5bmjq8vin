PURPOSE
  • Compute ArcFace embeddings on a reference set to form a normalized centroid, then score each aligned image
    by cosine similarity to that centroid (higher = closer to refs).
  • Two progress rows: REFS (no FPS; shows FAIL=rejects) then ARCFACE (FPS + FAIL=embeds failed).
  • Writes a lean CSV for compatibility and richer artifacts for downstream analysis.

USAGE (common)
  python3 -u /workspace/scripts/arcface.py \
    --aligned /workspace/data_src/aligned \
    --logs    /workspace/data_src/logs \
    --ref_dir /workspace/refs

CLI FLAGS
  --aligned DIR (req)               aligned images to score
  --logs DIR (req)                  log root (outputs under logs/arcface)
  --ref_dir DIR (req)               directory of reference images (recursive)
  --model any                       kept for interface parity (ignored)
  --batch INT (64)                  kept for parity; embedding is per-image in this runner

  # logging & help
  --help on|off (on)                write /workspace/scripts/arcface.txt then proceed
  -h / --h                          print this help text and continue
